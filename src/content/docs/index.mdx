## Meet the Creators: Emilio and Eduardo

Hello, fellow learners! We're thrilled to introduce ourselves, the creators of this codelab. I'm Eduardo, and alongside me is Emilio, the co-creator of this project. Coming from the vibrant city of Madrid, we're here as exchange students with a shared passion for Computer Science.

Our journey in the world of coding and technology has been fueled by a genuine love for problem-solving and innovation. Emilio and I believe that the intersection of Computer Science is where ideas come to life, and we're excited to share our knowledge and experiences with you through this codelab.

We understand the thrill of exploring new languages, frameworks, and concepts, and we're here to guide you through the process with dedication.
