# Functionality
## Gradle script
First of all we must change from the Gradle Script some files to be able to use a pluggin. This is explained on the .... part

#TODO link to the part where it is explained what to change from Gradle Script. Write in the 3 periods above the name of the document where this info is going to be

## First fragment
The first part will be to get the document where we will change the functionality. Lets go to app/java/com.example.newproject/FirstFragment.
Firstly, we will add an import we need for the chronometer to be created

#TODO code snipet import android.widget.Chronometer;

Afterwards we will prepare all the variables we need for this project. This variables will be written after this line of code

#TODO code snipet private FragmentFirstBinding binding;

The variables will be the followings:

The chronometer we will use:

#TODO code snipet    private Chronometer chronometer;

A variable that will let us know if the chronometer is on or off
#TODO code snipet    boolean isRunning = false;

The next variable will work as the initial moment that will be set to the chronometer
#TODO code snipet    long base;

The variable stop will be use to get the specific time after stoping the chronometer. This is needed because the base is going to be based
on SystemClock.elapsedRealtime(); which return the time since the system was booted, and include deep sleep. Because of this, when we try
to stop the clock(), we are not really stoping it because the time since the system was booting would be increased, so we will need to get the 
specific stop hour to calculate the moment of stop of the chronometer.

#TODO code snipet    long stop;

This variable will get the difference between the stop moment and the base moment we got when we start again the chronometer.
#TODO code snipet    long totalTime = 0;


Afterwards we will need to initialize the chronometer and a list which get the times when we press the lap buttons
The two lines of code will need to be below the following line.
 
#TODO snipet code super.onViewCreated(view, savedInstanceState);

The two lines to add are the followings

#TODO snipet code chronometer = binding.idCMmeter;
             List<String> lapList = new ArrayList<>();

Finally we will need to change the eventListener is already created and create a few more.
As we have change the id from the next button we must change the binding reference to the following

#TODO code snipet binding.nextButton.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener(){...

As we will need to send some arguments to the second fragment. We must cast to an array of strings the list of lapList
and send it to second fragment. This listener will finally look like this:

#TODO code snipet 
binding.nextButton.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
            @Override
            public void onClick(View view) {
                String[] myArray = lapList.toArray(new String[0]);
                FirstFragmentDirections.ActionFirstFragmentToSecondFragment action = FirstFragmentDirections.actionFirstFragmentToSecondFragment(myArray);
                NavHostFragment.findNavController(FirstFragment.this).navigate(action);
            }
        });


We must prepare as well on the graph this parameter to be passed so we must go to app/res/navigation/nav_graph.xml
When we get there we must click on the SecondFragment screen and on the attributes part in the arguments you will have
"Nothing to show". To add an argument please press on the + sign
#TODO nav_graph_arguments.png

Pressing on the + sign you will get the follwing screen, fill it as it is shown

#TODO arguments_creation.png

For the reset button we only need to reset the total time to 0 and get the base again.
We will let the functionality of chronometer as it was before pressing the start, so if it was stopped the chronometer will
be stopped and in case it was running, the chronometer will automatically start running.

#TODO snipet code 
binding.resetButton.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
            @Override
            public void onClick(View view) {
                // on below line we are checking if
                // chronometer is running or not.
                stop = SystemClock.elapsedRealtime();
                totalTime = 0;
                base = SystemClock.elapsedRealtime() - totalTime;
                chronometer.setBase(base);
                if (isRunning){
                    chronometer.start();
                }
                else {
                    chronometer.stop();
                }
                lapList.clear();
            }
        });
    }

The next button will be the lap button. As it is described on the code, this function will prepare a string
with the actual time that is set on the chronometer and save it on the array lapList.

#TODO snipet code
binding.lapButton.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
            @Override
            public void onClick(View view) {
                long millis = SystemClock.elapsedRealtime() - chronometer.getBase();

                int seconds = (int) (millis / 1000);
                int minutes = seconds / 60;
                seconds = seconds % 60;
                int hours = minutes / 60;
                minutes = minutes % 60;

                String lapTime = String.format("%d:%02d:%02d", hours, minutes, seconds);
                lapList.add(lapTime);
            }
        });

The last function will be the button of star/pause. This function will check if the chronometer was running or not
before pressing the button. In case it was running it will get the time where it stopped, to start afterwards from that time.
If it wasn't running it will calculate the base based on the totalTime of the chronometer on and start it


#TODO snipet code
binding.startPauseButton.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
            @Override
            public void onClick(View view) {
                // on below line we are checking if
                // chronometer is running or not.
                if (isRunning) {
                    binding.startPauseButton.setText("Start");
                    isRunning = false;
                    stop = SystemClock.elapsedRealtime();
                    totalTime = stop - base;
                    chronometer.stop();
                } else {
                    binding.startPauseButton.setText("Stop");
                    isRunning = true;
                    base = SystemClock.elapsedRealtime() - totalTime;
                    chronometer.setBase(base);
                    chronometer.start();
                }
            }
        });

## Second fragment

For the second fragment you must prepare the code to get the parameters
We receive it in a new string array called lapList and afterwards create a string to 
display the values of the lap on the screen. This two lines must be below the following line

#TODO snipet code super.onViewCreated(view, savedInstanceState);

The two lines would be:

#TODO snipet code 
String[] lapList = SecondFragmentArgs.fromBundle(getArguments()).getMyArg();

String myString = String.join("\n", lapList);
