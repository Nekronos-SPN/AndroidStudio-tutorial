title: Project Structure
description: Understanding how the project files are structured
---

When you create an Android project in Android Studio, it follows a well-defined file and folder structure. Understanding this structure is crucial for efficient development and deployment. In this guide, we'll walk through the key directories and files that constitute an Android project.
There are many files and folders in the structure auto-generated by the IDE, only the relevant to this project are hightlighted for easier understanding.

## Project Root

The project root directory contains configuration files and build scripts. Let's take a closer look at the essential components in the root directory:

- `app`: This directory contains the main source code and resources for your Android application. It includes subdirectories like src, res, and manifests.
- `gradle`: Houses the Gradle wrapper files, which are used to manage the Gradle build tool version for your project.

## App Module (app folder)

The app module is where the core of your Android application resides. Let's explore the contents of this directory:

- `src`: Contains the main source code for your app. Inside src, you'll find main (for the main codebase) and additional directories for test code.
- `main`:
	- `java`: Java source code packages for your app.
	- manifest: Describes essential information about the app, such as activities, permissions, and the app's components.
	- `res`: Resources like layout files, drawables, values, etc.

## Gradle Scripts (gradle folder)

The gradle directory contains additional scripts and configuration files related to the Gradle build system:

- `build.gradle` (Module: app): Configures the build script for the app module specifically. It includes dependencies, build types, and other settings.
- `build.gradle` (Project: MyApp): Configures the build script for the entire project. It defines build configurations, dependencies, and other settings that apply globally.
- proguard-rules.pro: ProGuard configuration file, used for code shrinking and obfuscation.
- gradle-wrapper.properties: Configuration for the Gradle wrapper, specifying the Gradle distribution and version used for the project.
- gradle.properties: This file can include custom properties and values that influence the build process
- local.properties: This file is typically not included in version control systems like Git, allowing developers to have personalized SDK paths on their local machines.
- `settings.gradle`: Lists the modules (subprojects) that are part of the project.
