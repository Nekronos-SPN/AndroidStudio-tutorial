Android Studio is a comprehensive Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that includes an advanced code editor, app templates, and various tools for development, debugging, testing, and performance analysis. It simplifies the app development process, making it faster and more efficient. You can use Android Studio to test your apps on a range of preconfigured emulators or your own mobile device. Additionally, it facilitates the building and publishing of production apps on the Google Play store.
